# AlternateTimeModule
A Drupal module to allow you to alter time on your Drupal site.

This is offered for free and mostly as a sample of what you can do.

This module adds several different alternate time formats and allows for a year offset to throw things into the past or future.
The additional formats are Terran Computational Time (TC), Stardate, Warhammer 40K Imperial, Ordinal time, and Dale Reckoning.  Note that this is more about time as a timestamp or on a page or article as opposed to working on a calendar which is way, way, way harder to do.

ToDo:
- Add more detail on usage
- Add more options to make it all a little prettier
- Maybe add more alternative time configurations
